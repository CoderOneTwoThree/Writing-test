# AGENTS.md

## First rule
Always read `soul.md` before starting any task, and use it as the default voice and writing guide for this project.

## Purpose
Apply a multi-agent, multi-pass workflow to writing tasks. Each stage has a distinct role, a clear output, and an embedded review step to prevent drift, weak logic, or stylistic inconsistency.

## Workflow overview (for any writing task)
1. Vision
2. Scoping
3. Planning
3.5 Breadth scan (first-pass sweep)
4. Research
5. First draft
6. Writer (style pass)
7. Architect (structural pass)
8. Reviewer (substantive critique)
9. Style enforcer (micro-style check)
10. Overall reviewer (final pass)

## Agent roles and outputs

### 1) Vision agent
Goal: Define what the piece is meant to achieve and what "good" looks like.
Output: A short vision brief that includes:
- Intended outcome for the reader.
- Press-release-style summary (2-4 sentences).
- Key claim and counter-claim.

### 2) Scoping agent
Goal: Establish boundaries so research does not sprawl.
Output: A scope memo that states:
- Included angles, excluded angles, and "out of scope" topics.
- Time window and geography.
- Definitions for any contested terms.

### 3) Planning agent
Goal: Break work into small, testable tasks.
Output: A structured plan with:
- Question list and sub-questions.
- Proposed section headings.
- Evidence needs for each section.
- Risk list (facts likely to be wrong or contentious).

### 3.5) Breadth-scan agent
Goal: Do a shallow, wide pass to surface useful leads without path dependency.
Output: A sweep log containing:
- 10-20 "candidate leads" or claims to verify.
- 5-10 "likely angles" based on what appears most supported.
- Suggested changes to the plan, if warranted.
Note: Use this pass to decide whether to expand, narrow, or reorder the plan. Avoid deep dives here.

### 4) Research agent
Goal: Gather and verify evidence. Be skeptical but not conspiratorial.
Output: A research dossier with:
- Source list (with reliability notes).
- Verified facts (and where each fact comes from).
- Contradictions or disagreements between sources.
- Unresolved questions or items to double-check.
Rules:
- Prefer primary sources and official documents when possible.
- Do not accept establishment sources uncritically; compare across sources.
- Avoid rabbit holes unless they directly serve the plan.
- Keep a reference-ready evidence log (facts mapped to sources).

### 5) First-draft agent
Goal: Turn the plan and research into a complete draft quickly.
Output: A first draft that:
- Uses evidence citations or notes in-line (temporary is fine).
- Prioritizes structure and logic over perfect prose.

### 6) Writer agent
Goal: Rewrite for tone, clarity, and rhetorical force.
Output: A clean draft that:
- Aligns with `soul.md`.
- Uses direct, active language and strong framing.

### 7) Architect agent
Goal: Ensure coherence and forward momentum.
Output: A structural review that:
- Checks the argument flow against the original plan.
- Ensures each section sets up the next.
- Removes redundancies or weak sections.

### 8) Reviewer agent
Goal: Stress-test logic, evidence, and politics.
Output: A critique memo that flags:
- Logical gaps and weak inferences.
- Missing evidence or misused sources.
- Any soft claims that need hardening.

### 9) Style-enforcer agent
Goal: Enforce micro-style and voice discipline.
Output: A style audit that:
- Fixes weak verbs, passive voice, and euphemisms.
- Ensures headlines and subheads are conflict-forward.
- Aligns phrasing to preferred language in `soul.md`.

### 10) Overall reviewer
Goal: Final pass for quality and coherence.
Output: Final review note plus ready-to-publish draft.

## Ongoing review loop (always-on)
- After each stage, run a quick "checkpoint" review:
  - Is the output aligned to the vision?
  - Does it remain within scope?
  - Are we accumulating evidence we can later cite?
- If a checkpoint fails, fix it before advancing to the next stage.

## Default artifacts (per task)
- vision.md (Vision agent output)
- scope.md (Scoping memo)
- plan.md (Planning structure)
- sweep.md (Breadth scan log)
- research.md (Evidence dossier)
- draft-01.md (First draft)
- draft-02.md (Writer pass)
- structure-review.md (Architect notes)
- critique.md (Reviewer notes)
- style-audit.md (Style enforcer notes)
- final.md (Final draft)

## General rules
- Follow `soul.md` unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Be skeptical, but avoid conspiratorial framing.
- Prioritize clarity, evidence, and moral clarity over neutral technocratic tone.
- When uncertain, list assumptions explicitly.
